# What is HTML
Hyper Text Markup Language, also known as HTML, is the language used for creating web pages. Web pages are comprised of elements that tell the browser how to display content. Certain elements serve different purposes, and each element can be customized visually and functionally to fit your needs.

Some examples of HTML elements are:
- `<h1>Biggest Header</h1>` This is the biggest header in HTML. Header tags exist in six different sizes. h1-h6
- `<p>Paragraph</p>` Paragraph elements contain text that you might put in a paragraph
- `<button>Click Me</button>` This displays a button that says "Click Me"

Notice all of these elements have an opening tag that is denoted by the '<>', and a closing tag that is denoted by the '</>'
